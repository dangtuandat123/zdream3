# Prompting Essentials

> Practical add-ons to strengthen your base prompt.

<Note>
  Before going into enhancements, make sure you read the [core prompting framework](/guides/prompting_guide_t2i_fundamentals#basic-prompt-structure) covered in Fundamentals.
</Note>

## Building on the Foundation

With your base **Subject + Action + Style + Context**, add details that will make your image even better.

### The Enhancement Hierarchy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Foundation (Required)">
    Start with the [core framework](/guides/prompting_guide_t2i_fundamentals#basic-prompt-structure). Keep it short and specific.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visual polish">
    Add specific visual details that refine the mood and composition:

    * **Lighting**: "bathed in golden sunlight from the terminator line"
    * **Color palette**: "deep blue and white Earth tones"
    * **Composition**: "composed using rule of thirds"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Technical precision">
    Add camera and artistic details:

    * **Camera settings**: "shallow depth of field, 85mm lens"
    * **Film/texture**: "film grain texture"
    * **Quality markers**: "shot on IMAX camera"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Atmosphere and intent">
    Set the vibe or mood:

    * **Mood**: "moody style", "peaceful", "chill", "uplifting"
    * **Atmosphere**: "relaxed evening", "soft morning light", "cozy", "dreamy"
    * **Narrative element**: "hint of mystery", "carefree moment", "quiet solitude"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enhancement Patterns by Use Case

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Character-focused">
    **Lead with character details, follow with setting enhancements**

    Pattern: Detailed character description → Action/pose → Style → Context → Atmospheric mood

    Example: "A weathered sea captain with salt-and-pepper beard and piercing blue eyes, standing confidently at ship's wheel, traditional maritime portrait style, on deck of sailing vessel with stormy seas, dramatic lighting with spray and wind"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Context-focused">
    **Start with location, add atmospheric and technical details**

    Pattern: Setting/location → Atmospheric conditions → Style → Technical specs → Emotional tone

    Example: "Ancient gothic cathedral interior with soaring ribbed vaults and rose windows, golden hour light streaming through stained glass, architectural photography style, wide-angle lens capturing vertical grandeur, sense of spiritual awe and historical weight"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Style-focused">
    **Begin with artistic reference, build subject and context around it**

    Pattern: Artistic style → Subject → Context → Technical execution → Mood reinforcement

    Example: "Art Nouveau flowing organic forms and elegant typography, depicting a graceful dancer in flowing silk dress, surrounded by stylized floral motifs, hand-drawn illustration with gold leaf accents, romantic and ethereal atmosphere"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Technical-focused">
    **Front-load camera/lighting specs for photographic precision**

    Pattern: Camera settings → Lighting setup → Subject → Composition → Quality markers

    Example: "Shot at f/1.4 with 85mm lens, professional studio lighting with softbox key and rim lights, elegant model in minimalist pose, clean white background, shallow depth of field, commercial fashion photography quality"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quality check before you hit Generate

Make a quick pass for:

* **Foundation**: Core elements present ([see framework](/guides/prompting_guide_t2i_fundamentals#basic-prompt-structure)).
* **Balance**: Enhancements support rather than drown the subject.
* **Specificity**: Swap vague words for concrete descriptors.
* **Order**: Lead with what matters most ([word order](/guides/prompting_guide_t2i_fundamentals#word-order-importance)).
* **Cohesion**: Everything points at the same idea.
